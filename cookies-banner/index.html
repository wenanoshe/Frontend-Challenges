                    <p>Cookies are an essential part of the web as well as a source of privacy concerns and security risks.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, it's important that web developers have a solid understanding of how cookies work. </p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Cookies were invented by Netscape in the mid-90's as a way to store some user information in the browser rather than requiring the web server to store it.</p>

                    <h2>Why do we need cookies?</h2>
                    <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol which means it remembers nothing between different request/response exchanges. The server handles each request as a separate distinct connection. The web server doesn't remember if you logged in already, set a preferred language, etc.</p>
                    <p>The use cases for cookies have evolved over the past two decades and they are now commonly used for:</p>

                <h2>What's in a cookie?</h2>
                <p>A cookie is simply text data that's stored by the browser and contains the following information:</p>
                <ul class="main__explication">
                    <li>A name-value pair containing the actual data (e.g. id = 1034820810)</li>
                    <li>An expiration date that sets the lifetime of the cookie (UTC/GMT format). If no expiration date is set, then the cookie is discarded once the user closes their browser.</li>
                    <li> domain and path of the server it belongs to. This is used to restrict which site the cookie can be shared with.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) Secure instructs the browser to send the cookie only over HTTPS</li>
                    <li>(Optional) HttpOnly prevents the cookie from being accessible via any client-side code.  This is used to prevent malicious scripts from stealing cookies with sensitive data like sessions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's a screenshot from Chrome Developer Tools for the cookies set by nytimes.com:</p>

                <h2>How is a cookie created?</h2>
                <p>To create a cookie, the server adds a Set-Cookie header to its HTTP response as seen in line 4 below:</p>
                <code>
                    <ol>
                        <li>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</li>
                        <li>Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8</li>
                        <li>Date: Thu, 13 Oct 2016 16:03:41 GMT</li>
                        <li>Set-Cookie: RMID=007f010109ee57ff1a960007; path=/; domain=.nytimes.com; expires=Fri, 13 Oct 2017 05:24:38 UTC</li>
                    </ol>
                </code>
                <p>Once the browser has stored the cookie, it is sent as part of every every subsequent request to the same URL as the content of a Cookie header in the HTTP request:</p>
                <code>
                    <ol>
                        <li>GET / HTTP/1.1</li>
                        <li>Host: www.nytimes.com</li>
                        <li>Cookie: RMID=007f010109ee57ff1a960007;</li>
                        <li>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.143 Safari/537.36</li>
                    </ol>
                </code>                
                <p>Notice that the client only sends the name-value pair and none of the other attributes (path, expiration date, secure).</p>
                <p>This is because the server doesn't care about those attributes.  The attributes serve as instructions from the server to the browser about how and when to send the cookie back.</p>
